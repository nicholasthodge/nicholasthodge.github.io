## Research

Describe your current interests, list your publications, and describe your past projects.

For ideas see [https://chris.simpkins.phd/research.html](https://chris.simpkins.phd/research.html).

## Selected Publications

In the `inc` directory of your site repository, store a BibTeX file containing all of the publications on which you are an author and no others.  This site template contains a sample `publications.bib` file.

This is how you insert a single reference.

- [% bibitem bibfile="publications.bib" citekey="YOUR_LAST_NAME2000chicken" %]

## All Publications

This is how you insert all of the references in a `.bib` file (leave off the `citekey`).  Note that this form of the `bibitem` shortcode returns a complete HTML list, so this should be on a line by itself.

TODO: this isn't implemented yet.

## Past Projects
